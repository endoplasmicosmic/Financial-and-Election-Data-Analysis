# Financial-and-Election-Data-Analysis - Python

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for analyzing financial records and election data using Python scripts. The analysis is divided into two main assignments: PyBank and PyPoll.

## Project Structure

### Files

- `PyBank/`: Directory containing the financial records analysis.
  - `pybank.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for PyBank analysis.
  - `budget_data.csv`: CSV file with financial records data.
- `PyPoll/`: Directory containing the election data analysis.
  - `pypoll.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for PyPoll analysis.
  - `election_data.csv`: CSV file with election data.

### PyBank Analysis

The PyBank analysis involves:
- Reading the financial records data.
- Calculating key financial metrics such as total months, total profit/loss, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.
- Generating a summary report with the calculated metrics.

### PyPoll Analysis

The PyPoll analysis involves:
- Reading the election data.
- Calculating the total number of votes.
- Determining the percentage of votes and total votes each candidate received.
- Identifying the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:endoplasmicosmic/Python-challenge.git
    cd Python-challenge
    ```

2. Open Jupyter Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

3. Navigate to the respective directories (`PyBank` or `PyPoll`) and open the Jupyter Notebooks (`pybank.ipynb` or `pypoll.ipynb`).

4. Run the cells step-by-step to perform the analysis and generate the results.
